<h1><center>Information about Website</center></h1>
<h3>1-Website</h3>
<p>      A website is a series of webpages bound together by a common <b>domain name</b> and displayed on <b>web servers</b>. Essentially, a website is a home for all the information you want to put out on the web. The information on your site is typically made up of a combination of text, images, videos and icons that come together to tell a unified story. </p>
<h3><b>2-History Of Website</b></h3>
<p>After the conceptualization of the internet and a series of technological advancements paved the way, the first website, as we know it today, launched in <b>1991. Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a computer scientist, is responsible for creating the world wide web and for facilitating the communication of HTML documents with web servers. This enabled content to be displayed on the internet in the way we have become accustomed to.</p> 
<h3>3-Website Components</h3>
<h4>Web Hosting</h4>
<p>Web host gives a home to websites and enables them to be displayed online. Web hosts are servers that store the information that stands behind each and every website. These servers work to ensure that your site will appear on a visitor's screen whenever they try to access it.</p>
<h4>Domain Name</h4>
<p>A domain name is the web address of your site. This is what makes it easily identifiable and findable online.Domain names have to be purchased through official domain registrars as no two domain names can be exactly the same.Often, domain names are the same as a brand name. For example, if you have a brand name olive, you might have a domain name of olive.net. </p>
<h3>4-Types of Websites</h3>
Following are the types of Website
<h4>Static Website</h4>
<p>Static websites are sites that do not adapt, but instead have fixed elements. They are made up of pages coded with HTML and always appear the same unless you go into the backend of a page to change its code. These are often the simplest form of website to create as they do not require any form of flexibility. Any website type can be static, it simply requires greater upkeep should you choose to make a change to your site.</p>
<h4>Dynamic Website</h4>
<p>Dynamic websites are sites that adapt according to circumstances and users. They utilize databases which can then present varying information across many pages depending on a number of factors. These might include who is accessing the pages, when they are being accessed, and more. This strategy is often used by large websites since the maintenance is lower.  For example an <b>E-Commerce</b> website with a shopping cart would have to be dynamic as it changes per user. </p>
<h3>5-Web Development</h3>
<p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>
<h3>Languages Used for Designing a Website</h3>
<h3>6-HTML</h3>
<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is Front end language used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.</p>
